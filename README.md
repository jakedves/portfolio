# Portfolio Website

## What is This?

This is a front-end based website, to showcase some of my work that I've been able to do both within and outside of my degree at the University of Bath. It doesn't contain much on it's own, but provides an overview of some of the areas in technology I've been able to explore.

## Technologies

The technologies used to build this website are:
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript
- React.js

I've chosen these technologies mainly due to the requirements I had for this website. A static website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I decided to also use React.js as it's a declarative framework, like SwiftUI that I have worked with in the past. It also allows us to use JSX, which makes building UI elements become very similar to how they would be built using HTML, and it often makes a lot more sense to build UIs in this way.

## To Do:

Currently, I'm working on updating the projects section, and making the website responsive across devices. Responsive design was what I was looking to improve upon as initially this website wasn't responsive at all, and now everything is responsive besides the Projects page, and I've decided that on smaller screens, there isn't really a way to have the amount of information I have in a presentable way. This has led me to want to redesign the projects page, and then make that responsive, and then publish the responsive website as one, rather than having a half-responsive site.
